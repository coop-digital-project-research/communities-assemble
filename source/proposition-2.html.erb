<p>
  Assemble will help you learn about your group, explore what your goals are, and suggest more formal legal structures that might help you to achieve them.
</p>

<p>
  You'll be asked a number of questions about you and your group. It's important to answer the questions as yourself, and not on behalf of your group. When you're done, you can share Assemble with others in your group and compare your results. It will take around 20 minutes to complete.
</p>

<p>
  When you answer the questions, think about where you'd like your group to be in the future - not how it is set up now.
